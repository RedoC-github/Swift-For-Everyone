 # Swift For Everyone
 ### Introduce - Teach Swift as The Best Way
 ---
 
 ðŸš€ Motivation
 ---
 According to [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020), 59.5% of developers loved Swift. And it shows high differences to compare with Obj-C recorded 23.4%. Also, this trend is continuing since Swift appeared. Anyone cannot disprove Swift'll be the best way to change the world by making a splendid app. Therefore, lots of students are trying to learn Swift. But there is a problem. There isn't any solid curriculum that teaches basic computer science concepts, such as Procedure or Repeat. Of course, there are some excellent curriculums, like Swift Playgrounds. So I had introduced it to my friends who want to learn to code. But most of them reacted it's too hard. While watching them, I decided to make an easy but solid Swift curriculum. And it is **Swift For Everyone**.

 ðŸ§¾ About Curriculum
 ---
 You can learn about basic computer science concepts by doing five levels.

 - Level 1: Single Command
 - Level 2: Multi Command, Procedure Oriented
 - Level 3: Repeat, Advanced Procedure Algorithm
 - Level 4: Advanced Repeat Algorithm
 - Level 5: Problem Solving

 Also, I composed sections to make you think more about how to solve the problem. For instance, you'll wonder how to repeat commands hundreds, even thousands of times in Level 2. And there is an answer in Level 3.

 UI contains three parts: code editor, canvas(shows result), and terminal. At each level, there is the mission to complete the level and hints to solve. You can find them in the terminal(black one). When you run code successfully also satisfy all conditions to complete, the terminal will show a green sentence 'MISSION COMPLETE.' Then click the next level link.
 
 Also, Swift For Everyone supports some features that not only helps to code easily, but also open the door to disabled. The editor will highlight important keywords(once to each word). If you have bad sight, click 'visual button(eye icon, by init button)' to size up font. Click one more time to change normally. ðŸ‘€
 
 Everything is ready. Go ahead!
