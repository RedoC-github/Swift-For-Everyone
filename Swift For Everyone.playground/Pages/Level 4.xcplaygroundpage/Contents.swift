we know what that means, right?
It let code repeat ten times.

Meanwhile, how can we repeat a hundred times? Think about how we do and write a code that repeats 100 times.

At this level, you can add more rect functions in the code parameter.

mission: change placeholder and let code repeat a hundred times.
(you should draw something)
